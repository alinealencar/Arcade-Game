In this game, you have to move the little boy across the stone road and get to the water without touching any bugs.

The bugs travel from the left to the right, each time with a different speed.

You can only use four commands to move the little boy: 

	UP ARROW: The little boy goes up a square;
	DOWN ARROW: The little boy goes down a square;
	LEFT ARROW: The little boy goes a square to the left;
	RIGHT ARROW: The little boy goes a square to the right.

You cannot move the little boy outside the limits of the board.

Have fun!
