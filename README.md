In this game, you have to move the little boy across the stone road and get to the water without touching any bugs.

The bugs travel from the left to the right, each time with a different speed.

You can only use four commands to move the little boy: 

	UP ARROW: The little boy goes up a square;
	DOWN ARROW: The little boy goes down a square;
	LEFT ARROW: The little boy goes a square to the left;
	RIGHT ARROW: The little boy goes a square to the right.

You cannot move the little boy outside the limits of the board.

You have 4 lifes (3 hearts plus a last chance). These hearts will show up in the bottom-right corner of your screen.

Everytime you reach the water, you get one point. These points will show up in the upper-left corner of your screen.

Have fun!
